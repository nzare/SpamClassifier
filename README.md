# Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes
Spam detection is one of the major applications of NLP. 
All of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.

Here **Naive Bayes algorithm** is used to create a model that can classify dataset SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. 

Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. 
Also, this is a **supervised learning** problem, as we know what are trying to predict. 
We will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.

Dataset originally compiled and posted on the **UCI Machine Learning repository** which has a very good collection of datasets for experimental research purposes is used.
